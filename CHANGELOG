ENTRY 1

* Shifted the extraction of next links to config. This supports greater flexibility in type of data. Case example: The parser can be used to fetch data from API iteratively by getting the next link correctly from the data previously got.
* Added timestamp messages
* Made it less python 2 specific. Syntax should work for python 3 as well. Not tested.
